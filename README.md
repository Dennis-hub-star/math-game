Overview

The Math Target Game is a fun and interactive web-based game where players solve math puzzles to reach a target number using a set of given numbers. The game includes two difficulty levels—Easy and Hard—with varying time limits and challenges. Players earn points based on correct answers, and their performance is evaluated at the end of the game.
